# HTML Colors with Names
This is a project I have done for my recent obsession with color names. In order to make the use of color names for the web more easily, I listed all 140 web colors with Names, Hex and RGB in lemon shapes that are big enough to get a feel of the colors in light and dark backgrounds. Along with color blindness simulator for each color, so you can ensure the colors are also colorblind-friendly on your projects.
